    "Structured Query Language (SQL) is a very useful declarative language for working with data. It is usually supported (with some variation) by relational databases. The tutorialspoint SQL Quick Guide is a handy cheat sheet for a lot of the syntax. As a data user, access to data will usually consist of a more or less complicated SELECT statement.\n",
